# ALAB308.2
## This repo is my submission to the practice lab 308.2: Control Flow.

## Activity 1
Activity 1 was to create a javascript function that determines the space needed for a certain amount of plants, how many will grow after x weeks, and whether the garden can contain all the plants.
It also needed to return whether the plants needed to be Pruned or Monitored based on how much space the new growth would take up. If there was plenty of space, more plants would be planted.

## Activity 2 
Activity 2 was to determine how much space 100 plants after 10 weeks would take up, and how much additional space would be needed if 100 plants were to be planted.

## Activity 3
Activity 3 was to create and try/catch block that would throw and handle an error if the maximum amount of garden space was exceeded.
